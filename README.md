## How to run Reddit Submission Flusher
1. Go to [Reddit Apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) and register a new application. Give it a **name**, select **script**, give it a **description** and finally, set the **redirect uri** to **https://127.0.0.1**.
2. Clone this repository.

  `$ git clone https://github.com/crlsmnzs/Reddit-Post-Flusher`
  or download as a ZIP.

3. Open a terminal window in the location you cloned/extracted the repository to and install the modules in `requirements.txt`.

  `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

4. Open `main.py` and edit the value of the variable **subName** to be the name of your subreddit (e.g: BlackPeopleTwitter, AskReddit, EarthPorn). You may close the file afterwards.
5. Open `praw.ini` and edit the values at the bottom.

## How to run Reddit Submission Flusher... scheduled.

I added a `main_schedule.py` file which can be run once and then left open. It will then run every Monday at midnight. This would make more sense if you are running the script from a VPS â€” if you decide to run this script from home, just manually run `main.py` when needed.
