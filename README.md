**0.** Install [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5.exe).

**2.** Clone this repository.

  `$ git clone https://github.com/crlsmnzs/Reddit-Post-Flusher` or download as a ZIP.

**3.** Open a terminal window in the location you cloned/extracted the repository to and install the modules in `requirements.txt`.

**4.** Open `main.py` and edit the value of the variable `subName` to be the name of your subreddit (e.g: BlackPeopleTwitter, AskReddit, EarthPorn). You may close the file afterwards.

## How to run Reddit Post Flusher... scheduled.

I added a `main_schedule.py` file which can be run once and then left open. It will then run every Monday at midnight. This would make more sense if you are running the script from a VPS â€” if you decide to run this script from home, just manually run `main.py` when needed.
